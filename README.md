# cycle-robot-drivers

A collection of [Cycle.js](http://cycle.js.org/) packages containing [drivers](https://cycle.js.org/drivers.html) and [components](https://cycle.js.org/components.html) for programming [robots](http://pixar.wikia.com/wiki/WALL%E2%80%A2E_(character)).

* [@cycle-robot-drivers/action](./action)
* [@cycle-robot-drivers/screen](./screen)
* [@cycle-robot-drivers/sound](./sound)
* [@cycle-robot-drivers/speech](./speech)
* [cycle-posenet-driver](./3rdparty/cycle-posenet-drivers)

All packages were tested with Chrome browser (>= 65.0.3325.181) only.

## Getting started

To build all packages, simply run `make` from the root directory of this repository.

To get your hands dirty, check out our [examples](./examples) or try building an app using [cycle-robot-drivers-app](https://github.com/mjyc/cycle-robot-drivers-app).
